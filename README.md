eusebian-canons
===============

This is an electronic version (SQL, JSON) of the [Eusebian canons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebian_Canons).

The ‘original’ data is in the data folder in text format. The files in the json and sql folders are generated with import.sql, e.g.,

```
sqlite3 sql/eusebian-canons.db ".read import.sql"
```

The JSON is generated with SQL exports, and then revised with this script to make it less SQL-y:

```
node redo-json.js
```

SQL Tables
-----------

 * sections
   definition of the sections; for each book, there is a section number with the corresponding verse reference
 * canon1, canon2, ... canon13
   each canon is given; different canons have different columns
 * canons
   this has the same data as the canon tables, except that all four columns are present, and the null value is used where the gospel is not referenced in that canon
